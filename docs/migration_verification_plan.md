## Phase 1: Initial Compilation and Dependency Check

### Step 1.1: Linting and Compilation Error Catalog with Windsurf Tools

**Windsurf Tool Sequence:**
```markdown
1. Use run_command to execute compilation and linting checks
2. Use grep_search to identify error patterns across the codebase
3. Use view_code_item to examine specific errors in context
4. Use codebase_search for semantic understanding of affected code
```

**Example Tool Execution:**
```markdown
# Run compilation to identify build errors
run_command("go build -v ./pkg/...", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp")

# Find all redeclaration errors with grep_search
grep_search("redeclared", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp", includes=["*.go"])

# View specific interface declarations with view_code_item
view_code_item("/path/to/file.go", "Package.InterfaceName")
```

- **Objective**: Create a comprehensive error catalog organized by pattern and root cause
- **Expected Outcome**: Structured error database with prioritization
- **Success Criteria**: Every error categorized and assigned a resolution strategy

#### AI Analysis Tasks:

1. **Structured Error Classification**:
   - Group errors by type: Interface mismatch, redeclaration, missing import, type mismatch, etc.
   - For each error type, identify common patterns and create resolution templates
   - Create memory entries for major error categories using the Error Tracking Memory Template

2. **Multi-dimensional Error Analysis**:
   - **Severity Analysis**: Categorize errors by severity (blocking, non-blocking)
   - **Dependency Analysis**: Map errors to dependency chains to identify upstream causes
   - **Pattern Analysis**: Identify recurring patterns that can be fixed with similar approaches
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Distinguish between migration-induced vs. pre-existing issues

3. **Error Resolution Planning**:
   - **Fix Templates**: Create reusable fix patterns for common error types
   - **Fix Sequencing**: Determine optimal order to minimize cascading fixes
   - **Batch Processing Strategy**: Group similar errors for batch resolution
   - **Test-Driven Resolution**: Define test cases to validate each fix

### Step 1.2: Dependency Graph Analysis and Import Path Resolution

```bash
# Find all files still importing from internal packages
find ./pkg -name "*.go" -type f -exec grep -l "github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/internal" {} \;

# Find all internal packages still being imported
grep -r "github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/internal" --include="*.go" ./pkg | awk -F'internal/' '{print $2}' | awk -F'"' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq

# Validate module dependencies
go mod graph | grep github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/internal
```

- **Objective**: Create comprehensive mapping of import dependencies to systematically resolve them
- **Expected Outcome**: Actionable plan for updating import paths with minimal cascading effects
- **Success Criteria**: All import paths properly mapped and categorized by fix complexity

#### AI Reasoning and Memory Construction:

1. **Import Dependency Graph Construction**:
   - Build a directed graph of package imports (who imports whom)
   - Identify strongly connected components (circular dependencies)
   - Create memory entries for critical dependency chains
   - Generate visualization of dependency relationships

2. **Import Resolution Strategy**:
   - **Direct Replacements**: Map straightforward internal â†’ pkg path replacements
   - **Interface Adaptation**: Identify where interfaces don't match between packages
   - **Type Conversion**: Locate instances requiring type conversion between packages
   - **Breaking Changes**: Flag imports that require API changes

3. **Multi-Session Planning**:
   - Create package-specific memories for each major component
   - Define clear entry and exit criteria for each package resolution
   - Structure fix batches that can be completed within single sessions
   - Establish checkpoints for validating progress

## Phase 2: Critical Interface Resolution

### Step 2.1: Fix Observability Package
This package has significant structural issues with interface redeclarations across multiple files, mismatched method signatures, and circular dependencies that require systematic resolution.

#### Pre-Session Preparation:
```bash
# Catalog all interface declarations in observability package
grep -r "type.*interface" --include="*.go" ./pkg/observability

# Find all implementations of these interfaces
grep -r "func (.*) .*Logger" --include="*.go" ./pkg
grep -r "func (.*) .*MetricsClient" --include="*.go" ./pkg
grep -r "func (.*) .*Span" --include="*.go" ./pkg
```

#### Memory Creation for Observability:
```markdown
Package: pkg/observability
Status: In Progress
Key Interfaces: Logger, MetricsClient, Span
Pending Issues: 
- Multiple interface redeclarations
- Inconsistent method signatures
- Circular dependencies
Next Steps: 
- Create canonical interfaces.go file
- Standardize method signatures
Implementation Decisions: 
- [To be populated during analysis]
```

#### AI Deep Analysis with Windsurf-Assisted Extended Thinking:

1. **Interface Variance Analysis**:
   - **Tool Application**: Use `grep_search` to find all interface declarations, then `view_code_item` to extract detailed signatures
   ```markdown
   grep_search("type.*interface", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability", includes=["*.go"])
   view_code_item("/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability/logger.go", "observability.Logger")
   ```
   - Create comparison matrix of interface methods across files
   - Identify semantic equivalences despite syntactic differences
   - Map the evolution pattern of interfaces to understand why variations exist

2. **Usage Pattern Analysis**:
   - **Tool Application**: Use `grep_search` to find implementations and consumers
   ```markdown
   grep_search("func \\(.*\\) (Info|Error|Debug)", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp", includes=["*.go"])
   codebase_search("Logger interface usage patterns", ["/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg"])
   ```
   - Analyze how each method is used in practice (parameter usage, error handling)
   - Create frequency analysis of method invocation patterns
   - Determine which signature variants are most widely used

3. **Dependency Cycle Breaking Strategy**:
   - **Tool Application**: Use file outlines to understand dependencies
   ```markdown
   view_file_outline("/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability/logger.go")
   view_file_outline("/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability/tracing.go")
   ```
   - Create directed graph of file-level dependencies
   - Identify minimal set of changes to break cycles
   - Evaluate interface extraction vs. package reorganization approaches
   - Design clean layering structure that prevents future cycles

#### Implementation Steps with Windsurf Tools:

1. **Create/validate interfaces.go with all interface definitions**
   - **Tool Application**: Use `write_to_file` or `replace_file_content` to create/update interfaces
   ```markdown
   # Check if file exists first
   find_by_name("/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability", "interfaces.go")
   
   # Create or update the file with standardized interfaces
   write_to_file("/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability/interfaces.go",
     "// pkg/observability/interfaces.go\npackage observability\n\n// Standard interface definitions\ntype Logger interface {\n  // Methods with standardized signatures\n}\n...")
   ```

2. **Update implementations for consistent interface usage**
   - **Tool Application**: Use `replace_file_content` to update implementations
   ```markdown
   # View current implementation
   view_code_item("/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability/logger.go", "DefaultLogger")
   
   # Update implementation to match interface
   replace_file_content("/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability/logger.go",
     "Update Logger implementation to match standard interface",
     [{ /*ReplacementChunks*/ }])
   ```

3. **Remove redundant declarations from individual files**
   - **Tool Application**: Use `grep_search` to find redundancies, then `replace_file_content` to remove
   ```markdown
   # Find redundant declarations
   grep_search("type (Logger|MetricsClient|Span) interface", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability", includes=["*.go"])
   
   # Remove each redundant declaration
   replace_file_content("/path/to/file.go", "Remove redundant interface declaration", [{ /*ReplacementChunks*/ }])
   ```

4. **Apply adapter pattern for implementation misalignments**
   - **Tool Application**: Combine `view_code_item` to understand implementations with `write_to_file` for adapters
   ```markdown
   # Create adapter implementations
   write_to_file("/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/pkg/observability/adapters.go",
     "// Adapter implementations to ensure interface compatibility\npackage observability\n...")
   
   # Verify implementation with compilation check
   run_command("go build ./pkg/observability/...", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp")
   ```

### Step 2.2: Fix Database Package
Resolve interface mismatches between internal/database.VectorDatabase and pkg/database.VectorDatabase implementations while addressing AWS authentication and connection pooling issues.

#### Memory Creation for Database:
```markdown
Package: pkg/database
Status: In Progress
Key Interfaces: VectorDatabase, GeneralDatabase
Pending Issues: 
- Interface mismatch with internal implementation
- Type conversion between models.Vector and repository.Embedding
- AWS IAM authentication handling
Next Steps: 
- Compare interface definitions
- Create standardized interfaces
Implementation Decisions: 
- [To be populated during analysis]
```

#### IDE-Assisted Interface Comparison:

1. **Structured Interface Comparison**:
   - Create side-by-side comparison of internal and pkg interfaces
   - For each method, document:
     - Parameter differences (name, type, order)
     - Return value differences
     - Semantic meaning differences
     - Error handling variations
   - Mark compatibility-breaking vs. fixable differences

2. **Type Conversion Mapping**:
   - Create exhaustive field mapping between equivalent types:
     ```go
     // Example mapping to be analyzed
     // models.Vector â†” repository.Embedding
     // - ID: direct match
     // - TenantID â†” ContextID: name difference
     // - Content â†” Text: name difference
     // - Metadata: needs field extraction/merging
     ```
   - Document serialization/deserialization differences
   - Analyze performance impact of conversions

#### Multi-Session Error Resolution Strategy:

1. **Approach per Error Type**:
   - **Method Signature Mismatches**: Create adapter functions with precise type conversion
   - **Parameter Name Differences**: Update to standardized naming convention
   - **Missing Methods**: Implement missing functionality
   - **Authentication Differences**: Standardize on single auth pattern

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Create standardized interface definition
   ```go
   // Define canonical database interfaces in pkg/database/interfaces.go
   type VectorDatabase interface {
     // Standard methods with proper signatures
   }
   ```

2. Implement direct type conversions (no adapter pattern)
   - Convert between `models.Vector` and `repository.Embedding` types
   - Ensure field mappings are correct (`tenant_id` â†” `context_id`, `content` â†” `text`)
   - Handle metadata extraction and merging properly

3. Update database implementation to match interface
   - Fix AWS authentication handling
   - Ensure proper error wrapping
   - Verify connection management (refresh, pooling)

### Step 2.3: Fix Repository Package
Standardize repository interfaces to resolve the pattern mismatch between API-specific method names and generic repository interface methods.

#### AI Design Decision Process:
1. **Repository Pattern Analysis**:
   - Analyze current separation between generic (Create, List, Get, Update) and specific (CreateAgent, ListAgents) method names
   - Evaluate pros/cons of generic vs. specific naming conventions
   - Consider interface composition as an alternative to adapter pattern

2. **Implementation Strategy Reasoning**:
   - Since backward compatibility is not required (app not in production), design direct implementation
   - Consider impacts on testing strategy and mock generation
   - Analyze query method similarities for potential consolidation

#### Implementation Steps:
1. Standardize repository interface definitions
   ```go
   // Define base repository interface with generic methods
   type Repository[T any] interface {
     Create(ctx context.Context, entity *T) error
     Get(ctx context.Context, id string) (*T, error)
     List(ctx context.Context, filter Filter) ([]*T, error)
     Update(ctx context.Context, entity *T) error
     Delete(ctx context.Context, id string) error
   }
   ```

2. Implement entity-specific repositories without adapters
   - Convert direct entity implementations (AgentRepository, ModelRepository)
   - Remove adapter layers between API and repository
   - Ensure transaction handling is consistent

## Phase 3: Package-by-Package Verification

### Step 3.1: Verify Core Packages
These packages have minimal dependencies and should be verified first, with systematic error handling approaches for each.

#### Linting Error Resolution Framework:

1. **Error Categorization Matrix**:
   Create a standardized approach for each error type encountered:

   | Error Type | Detection Approach | Resolution Strategy | Verification Method |
   |------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
   | Multiple declarations | `grep -r "type X"` | Consolidate to interfaces.go | Go build without errors |
   | Import conflicts | `go list -f '{{ .Imports }}'` | Update import paths | Successful compilation |
   | Unused code | `golangci-lint run --disable-all --enable deadcode` | Safe removal or documentation | No new errors introduced |
   | Interface mismatch | Compare method signatures | Update implementation to match interface | Interface satisfaction test |
   | Circular dependency | Build dependency graph | Extract shared code to common package | `go mod graph` verification |

2. **Session Continuity Strategy**:
   - Create package-specific memory at the start of each package verification
   - Document all errors found during verification
   - Record resolution approaches applied
   - Track pending issues for continued work
   - Create checkpoint at the end of each session

3. **Advanced Error Analysis with Extended Thinking**:

hey -n 1000 -c 50 http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
```

## Phase 6: Cleanup and Documentation

### Step 6.1: Remove Internal Package
Once all tests pass and functionality is verified:
```bash
# Add deprecation notice to internal directory
echo "This directory is deprecated and will be removed. Use pkg/ directory instead." > /Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/internal/README.md

# Optionally, rename for safety before final removal
mv /Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/internal /Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp/internal.deprecated
```

### Step 6.2: Update Migration Tracker
Mark all packages as completed in the migration tracker:
```markdown
| âœ… | `github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/internal/adapters` | `github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/pkg/adapters` | âœ… Migration Complete | - |
```

### Step 6.3: Documentation Update

3. Configuration requirements
4. Integration patterns

## AI-Assisted Execution Framework with Memory Management

This plan leverages Claude 3.7 Sonnet's extended thinking capabilities with Windsurf IDE's memory system to maintain context across multiple sessions while systematically addressing compilation and linting errors.

### Resolution Priority Order:

1. **Blocking Interface Issues**: Observability, Database, Repository interfaces
2. **Core Type Definitions**: Models, Config, Common utilities
3. **Implementation Mismatches**: Method signatures, parameter types
4. **Critical Unit Test Failures**: Tests for core functionality and utilities
5. **Import Path Resolutions**: Update remaining internal imports
6. **Integration Test Failures**: Component interaction tests
7. **Functional End-to-End Tests**: Complete user flow tests
8. **Linting and Style Issues**: After functionality is restored

   - **Tool Application**: Use IDE's execution and testing capabilities
   ```markdown
   # Verify compilation after changes
   run_command("go build ./pkg/[target_package]/...", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp")
   
   # Run specific tests for the modified component
   run_command("go test ./pkg/[target_package] -run=[TestName]", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp")
   ```
   - Execute incremental compilation checks
   - Run unit tests for modified components
   - Validate that fixes don't introduce new errors
   - Document unexpected behaviors or edge cases

#### 5. **Cross-Component Testing with Windsurf Integration Tools**:
   - **Tool Application**: Use IDE's cross-package analysis capabilities
   ```markdown
   # Find all imports of the modified package
   grep_search("import.*[target_package]", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp", includes=["*.go"])
   
   # Test integration with dependent packages
   run_command("go test ./pkg/[dependent_package] -run=[TestName]", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp")
   
   # For web services, use browser preview to test API endpoints
   run_command("go run ./apps/[app_name]/main.go", "/Users/seancorkum/projects/devops-mcp")
   browser_preview("API Test", "http://localhost:8080")
   ```
   - Test integration points between modified components
   - Verify end-to-end functionality across component chains
   - Update integration test expectations

#### 6. **Memory Creation and Session Closure**:
   - **Tool Application**: Document session outcomes for future reference
   ```markdown
   # Create or update package memory with the current state
   create_memory("Action": "update", "Title": "[target_package] Migration Status", "Content": "[detailed status]", "Tags": ["migration", "[target_package]"])
   ```
   - Document error patterns and their resolutions
   - Create test failure pattern memories with examples
   - Record tool sequences that were most effective
   - Define clear starting point for next session

### Memory Utilization Strategy:

At key points in the migration process, Claude will:

1. **Create Package State Memories**:
   - One per major package being migrated
   - Updated at the end of each session working on that package
   - Includes current status, pending issues, and next steps

2. **Create Error Pattern Memories**:
   - For recurring error types that require consistent handling
   - Documents the pattern, root cause, and resolution approach
   - Serves as reference for handling similar errors

3. **Create Test Failure Pattern Memories**:
   - For common test failure patterns across multiple components
   - Documents test intent, failure mode, and resolution approach
   - Provides templates for fixing similar test failures
   - Tracks related tests requiring the same fix pattern

4. **Create Implementation Decision Memories**:
   - For significant architectural or design decisions
   - Documents alternatives considered, trade-offs, and rationale
   - Records implementation notes and verification approach
   - Ensures consistent application of design principles

5. **Create Integration Point Memories**:
   - For critical component boundaries and integration points
   - Documents contract expectations and interaction patterns
   - Records environment and configuration dependencies
   - Serves as reference for debugging cross-component issues

6. **Reference Memories Explicitly and Deliberately**:
   - Begin each session by loading relevant memories
   - Reference specific memories when making related decisions
   - Cross-reference memories to build comprehensive understanding
   - Update memories with new insights or changes
   - Use memories to validate implementation consistency

This structured approach ensures continuity across sessions while systematically resolving the complex web of compilation, linting, and testing issues that emerge during the migration process. The deliberate memory creation and referencing strategy allows Claude to build a comprehensive understanding of the system architecture and maintain consistency across multiple migration sessions.
