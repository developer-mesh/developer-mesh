# Pass-Through Authentication Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Session Structure Enhancement
- Added `PassthroughAuth *models.PassthroughAuthBundle` field to `Session` struct
- Stores user-specific credentials for the duration of the session

### 2. Credential Extraction
- Created `extractPassthroughAuth()` method in MCP handler
- Extracts tokens from both HTTP headers and environment variables
- Supports multiple services:
  - GitHub (GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_PAT)
  - AWS (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN)
  - Slack (SLACK_TOKEN, SLACK_API_TOKEN)
  - Jira (JIRA_TOKEN, JIRA_API_TOKEN, ATLASSIAN_TOKEN)
  - GitLab (GITLAB_TOKEN, GITLAB_PAT)
  - And more...

### 3. Context-Based Forwarding
- Pass-through auth is added to context using `core.PassthroughAuthKey`
- Tool execution context includes passthrough credentials
- Maintains clean separation of concerns

### 4. Core Platform Integration
- Updated `createProxyHandler()` to extract passthrough auth from context
- Includes passthrough_auth in tool execution payload to Core Platform
- Logs credential forwarding for debugging

### 5. Security Features
- Tokens only held in memory during session
- No persistent storage of credentials
- Tokens never logged in full (only "found" messages)
- Support for multiple credential types (bearer, aws_signature, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. **internal/mcp/handler.go**
   - Added passthrough auth extraction
   - Updated session structure
   - Modified tool execution to include passthrough context

2. **internal/core/client.go**
   - Added PassthroughAuthKey context key
   - Updated proxy handler to forward passthrough auth
   - Added debug logging for credential forwarding

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated main README with passthrough auth section
   - Created detailed IDE setup guides with token configuration
   - Added testing documentation

## How It Works

```
1. User sets environment variables:
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_personal_access_token"
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"

2. User starts IDE (Claude Code/Cursor/Windsurf)

3. IDE connects to Edge MCP via WebSocket

4. Edge MCP extracts tokens from environment

5. Tokens stored in session (memory only)

6. When executing tools:
   - Edge MCP adds passthrough auth to context
   - Core Client extracts from context
   - Forwards to Core Platform with tool request

7. Core Platform uses user's tokens instead of service credentials

8. Actions performed as the user with full attribution
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
./scripts/test-passthrough-auth.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Pass-through authentication extraction detected
  ✓ GitHub token detected
  ✓ AWS credentials detected
  ✓ Service tokens detected from environment
  ✓ Total credentials extracted: 4
```

## Benefits

1. **User Attribution**: All actions show as performed by the actual user
2. **Permission Scoping**: Limited to user's actual permissions
3. **Audit Compliance**: Full traceability to individuals
4. **No Shared Credentials**: Each user uses their own tokens
5. **Easy Rotation**: Users can update tokens without config changes

## Security Considerations

- Tokens never written to disk
- Tokens not included in logs (only detection messages)
- Session-scoped storage (cleared on disconnect)
- TLS/HTTPS transport to Core Platform
- No token sharing between sessions

## Future Enhancements

1. Token validation before forwarding
2. Token refresh for OAuth tokens
3. Support for more authentication types
4. Token usage metrics
5. Automatic token rotation reminders
