  - Scores operations based on semantic similarity (up to 300+ points)
  - Understands CRUD patterns and common action verbs
  - Detects list vs single resource operations
  - Evaluates path depth and sub-resource relationships

- **ResolutionLearner** (`pkg/tools/resolution_learner.go`): Self-improving ML system

- **Docker Compose**: Full local development environment

### Planned but NOT Implemented

#### Features Built but Inactive
- **Vector Database / Semantic Search**:
  - pgvector tables and indexes created but empty
  - Embedding API endpoints return empty results
  - No actual embeddings being generated or stored
  - Semantic search is TODO in code
  - ~30% of codebase dedicated to unused vector features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**:
  - Agent tables exist but not populated
  - Task delegation logic not implemented
  - Workflow execution not connected

- **Embedding Models**:
  - Model catalog structure exists
  - Provider integrations coded but not used
  - Cost tracking tables empty
  - No actual embedding generation occurring

- **Authentication System** (tables exist, not fully implemented):
  - Organization and user tables created
  - JWT token structure defined
  - Session management tables present

- **Webhook Processing** (partially working):
  - Redis streams configured and working
  - GitHub webhooks can be received
  - Processing logic incomplete

### Working Authentication
- **Simple API Key Auth**: 
  - Static API keys in configuration working
  - Bearer token validation for REST API
  - Basic auth for tool credentials

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Required for Operation**:
  - PostgreSQL 14+ (for tool configs)
  - Redis 7+ (for queues and caching)
  - Go 1.21+ for building
  
- **Optional/Unused**:
  - AWS Bedrock (embedding models not used)
  - S3 (context storage not implemented)
  - pgvector extension (installed but not utilized)

### Testing Coverage
- REST API endpoints have basic tests
- MCP protocol has test scripts
- Dynamic tools have integration tests
- Edge MCP tested with Claude Code

### Known Issues & Limitations
- Semantic search returns empty results (TODO in code)
- Multi-agent orchestration not connected
- Email service not implemented
- Context storage to S3 not working
- Embedding generation disabled
- Vector database tables empty
- Organization registration flow incomplete

### What Actually Works
1. **Tool Discovery**: Point at any OpenAPI spec, it discovers and registers tools
2. **Tool Execution**: Execute any registered tool via MCP or REST API
3. **Claude Code Integration**: Edge MCP works seamlessly with Claude Code
4. **GitHub Tools**: All 41 GitHub API endpoints working through dynamic tools
5. **Health Monitoring**: Automatic health checks for all registered tools
6. **Minimal Context**: InputSchema generation keeps token usage low

### What Doesn't Work
1. **Semantic Search**: Code exists but always returns empty
2. **Embeddings**: Full infrastructure built but never generates vectors
3. **Multi-Agent**: Tables exist but no orchestration logic
4. **Workflows**: Schema defined but execution not implemented
5. **Context Storage**: S3 integration not connected
- Embedding API conditionally registered based on provider availability

## Notes
