## Introduction
This guide provides best practices and operational procedures for administering the MCP Server in production and development environments. It is intended for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and operators responsible for deploying, maintaining, and monitoring MCP Server.

---

## Installation & Deployment
- **Supported Platforms:** Docker, Kubernetes, Linux/Unix, MacOS
- **Quick Start:**
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Copy and edit a config file from `configs/` (see `config.yaml` or `config.local.yaml`)
  3. Start with Docker Compose or run the binary directly
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Sensitive values (secrets, API tokens) should be injected via environment variables or secret managers.

---

## Configuration Management
- **Config Files:**
  - Located in the `configs/` directory. Use the file that matches your environment (e.g., `config.yaml`, `config.local.yaml`).
  - See the comments in each file for details on each setting.
- **Reloading Config:**
  - Restart the MCP Server after changing configs for changes to take effect.

---

## Authentication & Security
- **API Authentication:**
  - Supports JWT and API key authentication (see `api.auth` section in config).
  - Rotate secrets regularly and never commit real secrets to version control.
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - Use separate API keys for admin and reader roles.
- **Webhooks:**
  - Configure webhook secrets for GitHub and other integrations.
- **Least Privilege:**
  - Restrict database and Redis access to only the MCP Server.
  - For production, use secure passwords and network policies.

---

## Monitoring & Logging
- **Metrics:**
  - Prometheus metrics are exposed (see `monitoring.prometheus` in config).
- **Logs:**
  - Structured logs (JSON) are available; log level and output can be configured.
- **Alerting:**
  - Use Prometheus, Grafana, or your preferred stack for alerting on errors, latency, or resource exhaustion.

---

## Scaling & High Availability
- **Stateless Design:**
  - MCP Server can be horizontally scaled behind a load balancer.
- **Backend Scaling:**
  - Ensure your database and cache (Postgres, Redis) can handle increased connections.
- **Session Stickiness:**
  - Not required; all state is in the database/cache.

---

## Backup & Disaster Recovery
- **Database:**
  - Regularly back up your Postgres database (e.g., with `pg_dump`).
- **Cache:**
  - Redis is used for caching and can be restored from cold start.
- **Config Files:**
  - Store configs in version control (without secrets) and back up sensitive configs securely.

---

## Upgrades & Maintenance
- **Zero Downtime:**
  - Use rolling restarts with health checks for zero-downtime upgrades.
- **DB Migrations:**
  - Apply any database schema migrations before upgrading the binary.
- **Versioning:**
  - Track MCP Server versions and changelogs for compatibility.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues:**
  - Check logs for errors or stack traces.
  - Ensure all required services (Postgres, Redis) are reachable.
  - Verify API keys and secrets are set correctly.
- **Debugging:**
  - Increase log level to `debug` for more verbose output.
  - Use health endpoints to verify service status.

---

## FAQ & Best Practices
- **How do I rotate secrets?**
  - Update the config or environment variable and restart the server.
- **How do I scale MCP Server?**
  - Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer.
- **How do I recover from a crash?**
  - Restore the database from backup and restart MCP Server.
- **Where are logs and metrics?**
  - Logs are printed to stdout or the configured file; metrics are at `/metrics`.
