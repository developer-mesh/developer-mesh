# Go Workspace Issue Resolution

## Problem
When using Go workspace mode, Go was trying to resolve local workspace modules as remote dependencies, resulting in errors like:
```
github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/apps/mcp-server@v0.0.0: reading github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/apps/mcp-server/go.mod at revision apps/mcp-server/v0.0.0: unknown revision apps/mcp-server/v0.0.0
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. Module names used the full GitHub path (e.g., `github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/apps/mcp-server`)
2. This created ambiguity for Go when resolving dependencies within a workspace
3. Go couldn't determine if these were local workspace modules or remote modules to fetch

## Solution
Changed all application module names from GitHub paths to simple local names:

### Before:
```go
module github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/apps/mcp-server
```

### After:
```go
module mcp-server
```

### Steps Taken:
1. **Updated module names** in all go.mod files:
   - `apps/mcp-server` → `mcp-server`
   - `apps/rest-api` → `rest-api`
   - `apps/worker` → `worker`
   - `apps/mockserver` → `mockserver`
   - `test/functional` → `functional-tests`
   - `pkg/tests/integration` → `pkg-integration-tests`
   - `apps/mcp-server/tests/integration` → `mcp-server-tests`

2. **Updated all imports** to use new module names:
   ```bash
   # For each app directory:
   find . -name "*.go" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's|github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/apps/MODULE|MODULE|g' {} \;
   ```

3. **Fixed dependency issues**:
   - Removed unnecessary cross-module requires
   - Aligned dependency versions across modules

4. **Ran go work sync** successfully

## Benefits
- ✅ Go workspace mode now works correctly
- ✅ Clear distinction between local and external modules
- ✅ No more module resolution errors
- ✅ Simplified import paths for internal packages

## Remaining Compilation Issues
While the workspace issue is resolved, there are still some compilation errors to fix:
- Interface compatibility issues
- Undefined types/methods
- Unused imports

These are normal code issues, not workspace/module problems.
