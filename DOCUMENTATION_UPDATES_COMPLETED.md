- Removed reference to `architecture/adapter-pattern.md` (didn't exist)
- Removed reference to `api-reference/vector-search-api.md` (didn't exist)
- Updated to use existing files like `api-reference/rest-api-reference.md`
- Fixed references to `operations/MONITORING.md` and `operations/SECURITY.md`
- Removed references to non-existent troubleshooting files
- Updated all Quick Links to point to existing documentation

### 4. ✅ Rewrote Code Examples in Go

#### Updated `docs/examples/github-integration.md`:
- Replaced Python SDK examples with Go code
- Added proper Go package imports and structure
- Converted GitHubOperations class to Go struct
- Updated all async Python functions to Go functions
- Maintained webhook authentication examples in Go

### 5. ✅ Updated Package Documentation

#### Complete Rewrite of `pkg/queue/README.md`:
- Changed from "AWS SQS integration" to "Redis Streams integration"
- Updated all interfaces to use Redis Streams
- Provided Redis-specific configuration examples
- Added Redis CLI monitoring commands
- Included migration guide from SQS to Redis

#### Complete Rewrite of `pkg/worker/README.md`:
- Updated from SQS event processing to Redis Stream event processing
- Changed all function signatures to use StreamEvent instead of SQSEvent
- Updated configuration to use Redis Streams parameters
- Added consumer group examples
- Included troubleshooting for Redis-specific issues

## Verification

All changes were verified against the actual codebase:
- ✅ Redis Streams client exists at `pkg/redis/streams_client.go`
- ✅ Worker service uses Redis Streams for event processing
- ✅ Configuration files support Redis Streams
- ✅ Docker compose configurations include Redis service
- ✅ Make targets work with Redis-based infrastructure

## Migration Guide for Developers

If you have existing code or documentation referencing SQS:

1. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Remove: `SQS_QUEUE_URL`
   - Add: `REDIS_STREAM_NAME`, `REDIS_CONSUMER_GROUP`

2. **Update Code Imports**:
   ```go
   // Old
   import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/sqs"
   
   // New
   import "github.com/developer-mesh/developer-mesh/pkg/redis"
   ```

3. **Update Event Processing**:
   ```go
   // Old
   func ProcessSQSEvent(event queue.SQSEvent) error
   
   // New
   func ProcessStreamEvent(event worker.StreamEvent) error
   ```

4. **Update Monitoring Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Old
   aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url $QUEUE_URL
   
   # New
   redis-cli xinfo stream webhook_events
   ```

## Next Steps

While the priority documentation updates are complete, consider:
1. Creating the missing documentation files referenced in docs/README.md
2. Adding more Go code examples for common use cases
3. Creating visual diagrams for Redis Streams architecture
4. Adding performance benchmarks comparing Redis Streams to SQS

## Files Modified Count

- **Documentation files updated**: 15
- **Obsolete files deleted**: 5
- **Package READMEs rewritten**: 2
- **Total changes**: 22 files

All documentation now accurately reflects the current state of the Developer Mesh platform using Redis Streams instead of AWS SQS.
