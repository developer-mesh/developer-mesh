# Functional Testing Documentation Changes

## Summary of Changes

I've integrated the functional testing documentation into the main `docs/testing-guide.md` file rather than keeping it as a separate document. This ensures all testing documentation is in a single location for easier reference.

## Changes Made

1. Updated the Table of Contents to include the new Functional Testing section
2. Added Ginkgo and Gomega to the Prerequisites section
3. Added a comprehensive Functional Testing section with subsections:
   - Test Environment Overview
   - Running Functional Tests
   - Test Structure
   - Extending Functional Tests
   - Troubleshooting Functional Tests
4. Updated the Conclusion to mention functional testing

## Next Steps

1. Review the integrated documentation to ensure it meets your standards
2. Make any additional adjustments to the testing guide as needed
3. Commit the changes to your repository:

```bash
# Add the updated testing guide
git add docs/testing-guide.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Integrate functional testing documentation into main testing guide"

# Push to the repository
git push origin main  # Or your branch name
```

## Note

The standalone `FUNCTIONAL_TESTING_README.md` file has been removed since its content is now integrated into the main testing guide.
