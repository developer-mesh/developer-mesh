# Webhook Removal from MCP Server - Summary

## What Was Removed

### 1. Webhook Implementation Files
- ✅ Removed `/apps/mcp-server/internal/api/webhooks/` directory
  - `webhooks.go` - GitHub webhook handler
  - `webhooks_test.go` - Webhook tests
- ✅ Removed `/apps/mcp-server/internal/api/webhook_server.go` - Webhook server setup

### 2. Configuration Files
- ✅ Removed `/apps/mcp-server/internal/config/webhook_config.go` - Webhook configuration types
- ✅ Removed webhook proxy `/apps/mcp-server/internal/api/proxies/webhook_proxy.go`

### 3. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Removed `Webhook` field from API Config struct
- ✅ Removed webhook configuration parsing from `main.go`
- ✅ Removed `parseWebhookConfig` function
- ✅ Removed webhook-related imports

### 4. Test Updates
- ✅ Removed webhook test endpoints from `server_test.go`
- ✅ Removed `TestWebhookEndpoints` function

## Why This Was Done

1. **Correct Architecture**: Webhooks should be handled by the REST API where context management happens
2. **Separation of Concerns**: MCP server is for the MCP protocol, not webhook processing
3. **Avoid Duplication**: Having webhook handlers in both services would be confusing

## Current State

- ✅ MCP Server builds successfully without webhook code
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Clean separation between MCP protocol server and REST API
- ✅ Webhooks are handled exclusively by the REST API with Redis queue integration

## Data Flow Reminder

```
GitHub Webhooks → REST API (/api/webhooks/github) → Redis Streams → Worker
```

The MCP server now focuses solely on the MCP protocol implementation without webhook handling.
