## Context Management

### Context Creation

- **Use Unique Agent IDs**: Create unique agent IDs for different purposes or workflows to avoid context contamination.
- **Set Appropriate Max Tokens**: Set `max_tokens` based on the expected conversation length and complexity.
- **Include System Prompts**: Always include system prompts in initial contexts to guide AI agent behavior.

### Context Updates

- **Use Appropriate Truncation Strategies**:
  - `oldest_first` - Simple and effective for most use cases
  - `preserving_user` - Better for maintaining user message history 
  - `relevance_based` - Best for complex, long-running conversations

- **Batch Updates When Possible**: When adding multiple items to a context, batch them in a single update request.
- **Track Token Counts**: Keep track of approximate token counts client-side to predict truncation.

### Context Storage

- **Use Context Expiration**: Set `expires_at` for contexts that are no longer needed to aid in cleanup.
- **Implement Context Archiving**: Archive important contexts to S3 for long-term storage rather than keeping them active.
- **Use Sessions for Related Conversations**: Group related conversations using the same `session_id`.

## Tool Integration

### GitHub Integration

- **Use Targeted Queries**: When querying GitHub data, use specific parameters to narrow results and improve performance.
- **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Handle GitHub API errors gracefully, including rate limiting and authentication errors.
- **Process Webhooks Efficiently**: Set up webhooks to receive GitHub events and update contexts in real-time.

### Safety Practices

- **Avoid Destructive Operations**: Prefer non-destructive operations (e.g., archiving vs. deleting).
- **Implement Confirmation Steps**: Add confirmation steps for potentially risky operations.
- **Use Read-Only Access When Possible**: Limit write access to only necessary operations.

## Vector Search

### Storage and Retrieval

- **Use Consistent Models**: Stick to the same embedding model for a given context to ensure consistency.
- **Store Embeddings for Key Messages**: Not every message needs a vector embedding; focus on important content.
- **Set Appropriate Similarity Thresholds**: Start with 0.7 and adjust based on testing.

### Multi-Model Support

- **Use Specific Models for Specific Tasks**: Different embedding models excel at different tasks.
- **Clearly Mark Model Type**: Always include the `model_id` when storing and searching embeddings.
- **Consider Dimensionality**: Be aware of the different vector dimensions when using multiple models.

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

- **Use Redis for Hot Data**: Keep frequently accessed contexts in Redis for optimal performance.
- **Implement Client-Side Caching**: Cache common tool responses client-side when appropriate.
- **Set Appropriate TTLs**: Use shorter TTLs for frequently changing data.

### Database Optimization

- **Use Connection Pooling**: Configure appropriate connection pool settings for your workload.
- **Implement Query Optimization**: Use indexed fields for filtering and searching.
- **Batch Database Operations**: Group related database operations when possible.

### API Utilization

- **Use Pagination**: When retrieving large sets of data, use pagination to improve performance.
- **Implement Conditional Requests**: Use conditional requests with ETags to reduce bandwidth.
- **Optimize Request Frequency**: Avoid making unnecessary API calls.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- **Rotate API Keys Regularly**: Implement a regular rotation schedule for API keys.
- **Use Short-Lived JWT Tokens**: Generate JWT tokens with short expiration times.
- **Implement Proper Authorization**: Ensure proper access control for different operations.

### Data Protection

- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **Implement Data Minimization**: Only store the minimum necessary data for your use case.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of your deployment.

### Webhook Security

- **Verify Webhook Signatures**: Always verify webhook signatures to prevent tampering.
- **Use TLS for Webhook Endpoints**: Ensure webhook endpoints use HTTPS in production.
- **Rate Limit Webhook Processing**: Implement rate limiting for webhook endpoints.

## Development Practices

### API Integration

- **Use Client Libraries**: Utilize the provided client libraries for easier integration.
- **Implement Retry Logic**: Add retry logic for transient failures.
- **Use Proper Error Handling**: Handle all error cases appropriately.

### Testing

- **Test with Mock Responses**: Use mock mode for testing without real GitHub integration.
- **Implement Integration Tests**: Create comprehensive integration tests for your integration.
- **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure your code handles rate limits, errors, and edge cases.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection

- **Track Key Metrics**: Monitor API call rates, error rates, and response times.
- **Set Up Alerts**: Implement alerts for abnormal patterns or errors.
- **Use the Built-in Metrics**: Leverage the Prometheus metrics exposed by the server.

### Logging

- **Implement Structured Logging**: Use structured logging formats for easier analysis.
- **Set Appropriate Log Levels**: Configure log levels based on environment.
- **Centralize Log Collection**: Aggregate logs for easier troubleshooting.

## Deployment Best Practices

### Production Readiness

- **Use TLS in Production**: Always enable TLS for production deployments.
- **Implement High Availability**: Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer.
- **Configure Resource Limits**: Set appropriate CPU and memory limits for containers.

### AWS Integration

- **Use IAM Roles**: Leverage IAM Roles for Service Accounts for AWS integration.
- **Implement Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to services.
- **Enable Cross-Region Replication**: For critical data, enable cross-region replication.

### Backup and Recovery

- **Regular Database Backups**: Implement automated database backups.
- **Test Recovery Procedures**: Regularly test data recovery procedures.
- **Document Disaster Recovery Plans**: Create detailed disaster recovery documentation.
