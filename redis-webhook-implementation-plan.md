# Redis Webhook Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for migrating from SQS to Redis Streams for webhook event processing, with focus on cloud-agnostic architecture, deduplication, and intelligent context integration for AI agents.

## Architecture
```
External Service → REST API → Redis Streams → Worker Service → MCP Server
                      ↓                           ↓
                  PostgreSQL                Context Updates
                (metadata/audit)            (via WebSocket)
```

## Critical Components Checklist

### 1. Redis Infrastructure
- [ ] Redis Streams client with connection pooling
- [ ] Stream creation and consumer group management
- [ ] Health checks and circuit breakers
- [ ] Redis Cluster support for horizontal scaling
- [ ] Redis Sentinel for high availability
- [ ] Connection string configuration (support for Redis Cloud, AWS ElastiCache, etc.)

### 2. Message Schema & Serialization
- [ ] Define webhook event protobuf schema
- [ ] Schema versioning strategy
- [ ] Schema registry implementation
- [ ] Backward compatibility handling
- [ ] Message compression for large payloads

### 3. Deduplication System
- [ ] Composite message ID generation (tool_id:event_type:payload_hash)
- [ ] Configurable deduplication windows per tool
- [ ] Bloom filter for long-term deduplication
- [ ] Bloom filter persistence and rotation
- [ ] Deduplication metrics and monitoring

### 4. Event Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Hot storage (0-2 hours) - Full payload in Redis
- [ ] Warm storage (2-24 hours) - Compressed in Redis
- [ ] Cold storage (24+ hours) - Archive to S3/blob storage
- [ ] Daily summary generation for contexts
- [ ] Configurable TTLs per tool type
- [ ] Storage transition job scheduling

### 5. Worker Service Updates
- [ ] Redis Streams consumer implementation
- [ ] Consumer group coordination
- [ ] Batch processing with configurable size
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with in-flight message handling
- [ ] Worker health reporting and metrics
- [ ] Horizontal scaling support

### 6. Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Dead letter streams for failed events
- [ ] Exponential backoff with jitter
- [ ] Circuit breaker per tool/endpoint
- [ ] Alert thresholds for repeated failures
- [ ] Manual intervention tools (CLI/UI)
- [ ] Event replay mechanism

### 7. Context Integration
- [ ] Webhook-to-context mapping service
- [ ] Context priority levels for webhook delivery
- [ ] Rate limiting per context
- [ ] Event summarization service
- [ ] Summary templates per tool type
- [ ] Summary caching strategy

### 8. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Redis Streams lag monitoring
- [ ] Consumer group health metrics
- [ ] Event processing latency tracking
- [ ] Deduplication effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Context update success rates
- [ ] Dashboard creation (Grafana/DataDog)

### 9. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Webhook payload encryption at rest
- [ ] PII detection and masking
- [ ] Audit trail for all webhook events
- [ ] Retention policy enforcement
- [ ] GDPR compliance (right to deletion)
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation validation

### 10. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Redis pipeline commands for batch operations
- [ ] Connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Payload compression algorithm selection
- [ ] Index optimization for webhook queries
- [ ] Caching strategy for frequently accessed events

### 11. Migration Strategy
- [ ] Parallel running of SQS and Redis (transition period)
- [ ] Migration scripts for existing webhook data
- [ ] Rollback plan
- [ ] Performance comparison metrics
- [ ] Gradual traffic shifting

### 12. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for Redis Streams client
- [ ] Integration tests for full pipeline
- [ ] Load testing for high volume scenarios
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests
- [ ] Multi-region latency tests
- [ ] Deduplication effectiveness tests

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Redis Memory Pressure**
   - Mitigation: Implement aggressive TTLs and archival
   - Monitor memory usage closely
   - Have overflow to disk strategy

2. **Network Partitions**
   - Mitigation: Redis Sentinel for automatic failover
   - Consumer group state recovery
   - Duplicate processing tolerance

3. **Message Ordering**
   - Mitigation: Per-tool-id ordering guarantees
   - Timestamp-based reconciliation
   - Idempotent event processing

### Operational Risks
1. **Migration Failures**
   - Mitigation: Parallel running period
   - Comprehensive rollback plan
   - Incremental migration approach

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Load testing before migration
   - Gradual traffic shifting
   - Performance baseline establishment

## Success Criteria
1. Zero message loss during migration
2. 99.9% deduplication effectiveness
3. < 100ms p99 latency for event processing
4. Support for 10K events/second per instance
5. < 5 minute recovery time for failures

## Dependencies
1. Redis 6.2+ (for Streams features)
2. Go Redis client v8+
3. Protobuf toolchain
4. S3-compatible storage for archives
5. Monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus/Grafana)

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement Redis Streams transactions for exactly-once processing?
2. What's the maximum acceptable latency for context updates?
3. Should we support custom deduplication strategies per tool?
4. How should we handle webhook ordering requirements?
5. What's the budget for Redis infrastructure?
