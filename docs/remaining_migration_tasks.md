# Go Workspace Migration - Remaining Tasks

## Overall Status
- **Current Phase**: 6.2 - Build Configuration Updates
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23 (12:05)
- **Status**: In Progress (85%)
- **Projected Completion**: End of Q2 2025

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. GitHub Integration Test Issues (Phase 6.2)
- **Status**: Needs separate ticket (0%)
- **Details**:
  - Address import cycle between pkg/database, pkg/common/config, and apps/mcp-server/internal/core
  - Fix internal package usage violations and missing module metadata
  - Resolve API incompatibilities between GitHub adapter implementation and test expectations
- **Action Plan**:
  - Create dedicated ticket to address architectural issues
  - Break import cycles between packages
  - Update GitHub adapter API usage in tests to match current implementation
  - Verify build and test integration

### 2. Test Framework Modernization (Phase 5.4)
- **Status**: In Progress (15%)
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Update test helper functions to use pkg types instead of internal types
  - [ ] Create test fixture factories that generate pkg-compatible test data
  - [ ] Update testing framework dependencies
  - [ ] Ensure test mocks are compatible with current interfaces
  - [ ] Run test coverage analysis and add tests for uncovered code paths
- **Action Plan**:
  - Focus on one test category at a time (unit, integration, functional)
  - Prioritize most frequently used test helpers
  - Update mock implementations systematically

### 3. Test Performance and Stability (Phase 5.5)
- **Status**: In Progress (15%)
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Identify and optimize slow-running tests
  - [ ] Improve database operations in tests
  - [ ] Fix flaky tests with race conditions
  - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of test resources
  - [ ] Run full test suite with race detection
- **Action Plan**:
  - Profile test execution times to identify slowest tests
  - Apply targeted optimizations to database-heavy tests
  - Use race detector to identify concurrency issues
  - Implement better resource cleanup patterns

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 1. Documentation Updates (Phase 6.3)
- **Status**: In Progress (40%)
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Update API documentation to reflect new structure
  - [ ] Update package-level documentation and README files
  - [ ] Create integration guides for dependent systems
  - [ ] Document breaking changes and migration paths
  - [ ] Update architecture diagrams to reflect new structure
- **Action Plan**:
  - Start with critical packages (observability, database, repository)
  - Focus on interfaces and public API documentation first
  - Create package README files with usage examples
  - Update architecture diagrams to match final implementation

### 2. Final Verification and Release (Phase 6.3)
- **Status**: In Progress (20%)
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Perform clean build of all packages
  - [ ] Run performance benchmarks
  - [ ] Compare performance to pre-migration baseline
  - [ ] Conduct security review of migrated code
  - [ ] Create release notes and tag repository
  - [ ] Set up monitoring for post-migration issues
- **Action Plan**:
  - Set up automated verification pipeline
  - Create performance test suite for core operations
  - Document release criteria and migration guide
  - Prepare rollback strategy if needed

## Package-Specific Remaining Work

| Package | Status | Remaining Tasks | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|
| pkg/adapters | In Progress | Verify remaining adapter implementations | Medium |
| pkg/client | In Progress | Complete interface alignment | Medium |
| pkg/common | In Progress | Ensure consistent interface definitions | Medium |
| pkg/core | In Progress | Fix impossible nil checks in context manager | High |
| pkg/events | In Progress | Remove compatibility layers and focus on future state interfaces | High |

## Next Steps and Timeline

1. **Week of May 26, 2025**:
   - Complete GitHub integration test ticket creation
   - Begin test framework modernization (Phase 5.4)
   - Focus on pkg/core and pkg/events remaining issues

2. **Week of June 2, 2025**:
   - Complete test framework modernization (Phase 5.4)
   - Begin test performance and stability work (Phase 5.5)
   - Address remaining package-specific issues

3. **Week of June 9, 2025**:
   - Complete test performance and stability work (Phase 5.5)
   - Finalize documentation updates (Phase 6.3)
   - Begin final verification process

4. **Week of June 16, 2025**:
   - Complete final verification
   - Prepare release notes and finalize release
   - Set up post-migration monitoring

## Key Migration Principles

- **Forward-Only Migration**: Focus exclusively on future state without maintaining backward compatibility layers
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain clear boundaries between application code and library code
- **Test-Driven Verification**: Ensure all changes are verified by existing tests
- **Documentation First**: Update documentation in parallel with code changes
