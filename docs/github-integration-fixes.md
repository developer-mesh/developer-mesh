## Import Path and Circular Dependency Resolution

### The Problem
The GitHub integration had circular dependencies between the following packages:
- `github.com/S-Corkum/mcp-server/internal/adapters/github`
- `github.com/S-Corkum/mcp-server/internal/adapters/github/api`

This was causing compilation errors and making the code difficult to maintain.

### The Solution
1. **Created a shared errors package**: Moved error definitions to a new package `github.com/S-Corkum/mcp-server/internal/adapters/errors` to break the circular dependency.
2. **Updated import paths**: Modified all imports to reference the new errors package.
3. **Re-exported errors**: Created re-export wrappers in the github package to maintain backward compatibility.

## JWT Implementation for GitHub App Authentication

### The Problem
The JWT implementation for GitHub App authentication was incomplete, with placeholder code that didn't actually generate tokens.

### The Solution
1. **Improved JWT token generation**: 
   - Added proper JWT token generation using the `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4` package
   - Implemented proper private key handling and token claims according to GitHub's requirements
   - Added validation to ensure all required parameters are present
   - Enhanced error handling with descriptive messages

2. **Enhanced App Provider**:
   - Improved the `NewAppProvider` method to better handle key parsing
   - Added support for multiple key formats for better compatibility
   - Enhanced error messages to help diagnose authentication issues

3. **Enhanced Token Refresh Logic**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling in the `RefreshToken` method
   - Improved HTTP client configuration with proper timeouts
   - Added better response parsing and validation
   - Implemented proper logging of token refresh events

## Type Safety Improvements

### The Problem
The GraphQL client and REST pagination had type assertion issues that could lead to runtime errors.

### The Solution
1. **Enhanced GraphQL Page Info Extraction**:
   - Added type validation for all type assertions
   - Improved error handling with descriptive error messages
   - Added logging for type assertion failures
   - Implemented proper handling of nil values

2. **Redesigned REST Pagination**:
   - Replaced the generic interface-based pagination with type-specific methods
   - Implemented specialized handlers for different result types
   - Added proper error handling and type validation
   - Improved slice handling to prevent index out of bounds errors

## Error Handling Standardization

### The Problem
Error handling was inconsistent across the GitHub integration code.

### The Solution
1. **Centralized Error Definitions**:
   - Moved all error types to the new `errors` package
   - Created consistent error types with appropriate context information
   - Implemented better error wrapping for propagating errors

2. **Enhanced Error Context**:
   - Added additional context information to errors for better debugging
   - Standardized error creation and handling patterns
   - Improved error messages to be more descriptive

3. **Error Type Utilities**:
   - Added utility methods to check for specific error types
   - Implemented proper error unwrapping for nested errors
   - Added documentation for error handling patterns

## Integration with Existing Code

### The Problem
The changes needed to integrate with existing rate limiting, webhook validation, and error handling systems.

### The Solution
1. **Enhanced Webhook Validation**:
   - Fixed method signatures for webhook validation
   - Added support for IP-based validation
   - Improved extraction of remote addresses from headers

2. **Rate Limiting Integration**:
   - Updated rate limiting logic to work with the new error system
   - Added better handling of rate limit information from API responses

## Testing and Verification

A verification script has been added to ensure that all issues have been resolved:
- Checks for circular dependencies
- Verifies module integrity
- Tests compilation of the codebase
- Runs tests for the GitHub integration components

To run the verification:
```bash
./verify_github_integration.sh
```

## Additional Notes

These changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the code quality, reliability, and maintainability of the GitHub integration. The following best practices have been applied:

- **Separation of concerns**: Better package organization and responsibility separation
- **Type safety**: More robust type handling and validation
- **Error handling**: Consistent and informative error patterns
- **Documentation**: Improved code comments and documentation
- **Security**: Enhanced JWT implementation for GitHub App authentication
