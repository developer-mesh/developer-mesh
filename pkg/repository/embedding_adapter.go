DEPRECATED FILE

This file has been deprecated in favor of vector_bridge.go and the vector package.

The embeddingRepositoryAdapter and related functions have been moved to:
- github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/pkg/repository/vector_bridge.go

For direct access to the vector package, use:
- github.com/S-Corkum/devops-mcp/pkg/repository/vector

Please use those implementations instead.
