> A production-ready platform connecting AI agents to DevOps tools through a unified, standardized API

## Overview

Developer Mesh (Model Context Protocol) provides a standardized, secure interface for AI agents to interact with DevOps tools, manage conversation contexts, and perform vector-based semantic search. Built with Go workspaces for modular architecture, it bridges the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external DevOps tools.

### 🚀 Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Unified API supporting GitHub, with extensible adapter pattern for additional tools
- **Context Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of conversation contexts with S3 support
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search using pgvector with support for multiple embedding models
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing with SQS integration
- **Production-Ready**: Built-in observability, circuit breakers, and rate limiting

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built using Go workspaces for modularity and clean architecture:

- **Three-Service Architecture**: MCP server, REST API, and Worker services
- **Adapter Pattern**: Clean separation between business logic and external integrations
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous processing with AWS SQS support
- **Resilience Patterns**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, and bulkheads
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry tracing and Prometheus metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Pre-built Docker Images (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started - no build required!

```bash
# Clone for configuration files
git clone https://github.com/developer-mesh/developer-mesh.git
cd developer-mesh

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Pull and run the latest images
GITHUB_USERNAME={github-username} ./scripts/pull-images.sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Access services
# - MCP Server: http://localhost:8080
# - REST API: http://localhost:8081
# - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# - Grafana: http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Building from Source

For development or customization:

#### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24+** (required for workspace support)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14+ with pgvector extension
- Redis 6.2+
- Make
- AWS credentials (optional, for S3/SQS integration)

#### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/developer-mesh/developer-mesh.git
cd developer-mesh

# Copy configuration template
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your settings (especially API tokens)

# Start infrastructure services (includes PostgreSQL, Redis, LocalStack)
make dev-setup

# Build all services
make build

# Run database migrations
make migrate-local

# Option 1: Start services (in separate terminals)
make run-mcp-server
make run-rest-api
make run-worker

# Option 2: Run all services with Docker Compose
make local-dev

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```
