   - Confirmed proper adapter pattern usage in worker modules
   - Maintained clean separation between low-level and high-level operations
   - Ensured consistent method signatures across implementations

## Current Phase: Phase 5.1 - Worker Module Migration

**Progress (2025-05-21)**:
1. ✓ Identified application-specific logic in pkg/ directories
2. ✓ Created inventory of components to be relocated
3. ✓ Developed migration strategy for each component
4. ✓ Validated target locations in apps/mcp-server structure

**Application Logic Inventory**:

| Package | Target Location | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------------|--------|-------|
| pkg/mcp/tool | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/tool | Completed | Successfully migrated all tool functionality |
| pkg/mcp/tool/github | apps/mcp-server/internal/api/tools/github | Completed | All GitHub tool providers successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/event.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/models | Completed | Event models and filter functionality successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/context_test.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/models | Completed | Context model tests successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/event_test.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/models | Completed | Event model tests successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/adapter.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/adapters/interfaces | Completed | Adapter interfaces successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/configs.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/config | Completed | Configuration structures successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/context_manager.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/context | Completed | Context manager interface successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/database/config.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/database/config | Completed | Database configuration successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/engine.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core | Completed | Engine interface successfully migrated |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/webhook_config.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/config | Completed | Webhook configuration interface successfully migrated |

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin Phase 5.3 (Functional Test Alignment):
   - Update API client initialization in functional tests
   - Fix request/response handling to match new structure
   - Ensure authentication works properly in functional tests
   - Update model operation tests for CRUD operations

**Phase 5.2 Progress - Database Integration Test Fixes Complete**
- ✓ Verified worker module structure in pkg/worker and apps/worker
- ✓ Confirmed all components properly use pkg/queue implementations
- ✓ Added missing deprecation notices to internal/queue implementation
- ✓ Verified test mocks align with standardized interfaces
- ✓ Created comprehensive documentation for worker module usage (pkg/worker/README.md)

**Phase 5.2 Database Integration Test Fixes**
- ✓ Migrated vector database integration tests to use pkg/ repository structures
- ✓ Migrated relationship database integration tests to use pkg/ implementations
- ✓ Aligned tests with existing pkg/tests/integration infrastructure
- ✓ Created standardized database connection handling for integration tests
- ✓ Implemented proper test cleanup and resource management
- ✓ Ensured proper transaction handling in database tests

**Phase 5 Complete - SQS Event Type Alignment**
- ✓ Added deprecation notices to all internal SQS event type implementations
- ✓ Verified that worker modules correctly import and use pkg/queue implementation
- ✓ Confirmed all tests pass with the aligned implementations
- ✓ Applied forward-only migration approach consistent with previous phases

**Phase 4.2 Complete - Application Logic Relocation**
- ✓ Successfully migrated all application-specific logic from pkg/ to apps/ directories
- ✓ Properly placed all interface definitions in their respective target locations
- ✓ Applied clean architectural boundaries between shared library and application code
- ✓ Removed unnecessary compatibility layers for a more maintainable codebase

**Phase 3.2 Complete - All High Priority Packages Verified**
- ✓ pkg/aws: AWS configuration and clients
- ✓ pkg/chunking: Content chunking functionality
- ✓ pkg/embedding: Vector embedding services
- ✓ pkg/metrics: Metrics collection and reporting
- ✓ pkg/models: Shared data models

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Continue forward-only migration approach:
   - Focus exclusively on future-state implementation as we did with events
   - Remove compatibility layers and backward compatibility code systematically
   - Use new interfaces exclusively in all code moving forward

2. Apply lessons learned from event system simplification:
   - Identify and remove compatibility files first (look for compat.go, legacy.go, etc.)
   - Fix type declarations and interface definitions
   - Update implementation files with clean, modern Go patterns
   - Ensure all mocks are updated to match the new interfaces

3. For each package:
   - Run initial build to identify errors
   - Remove all legacy/compatibility code
   - Fix specific implementation issues (imports, type mismatches, etc.)
   - Run targeted builds for verification
   - Update tests to match the new implementations

4. Integration verification approach:
   - Verify cross-package dependencies after each package update
   - Ensure updated packages integrate correctly with previously verified packages
   - Run integration tests between related packages
   - Document any patterns that emerge for future phases

**Tools and Techniques**:
- Continue using the established systematic approach for code cleanup
- Apply direct implementation instead of compatibility bridges
- Focus on removing rather than adapting legacy components
- Run incremental builds to verify each step
- Document removal patterns for future package migrations
