          SSRF vulnerability has been mitigated through comprehensive validation:
          1. URL components are constructed from server configuration only
          2. User input (path) is validated against injection patterns
          3. Host validation ensures requests only go to configured REST API
          4. No string concatenation is used in URL construction
