# DevOps MCP Server

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server provides AI agents with a unified API for DevOps tool integrations and context management.

## üöÄ Features

### DevOps Integration
- **Unified API**: Standardized REST API for integrating AI agents with GitHub
- **Tool Operations**: Execute GitHub operations through a consistent interface
- **Event Handling**: Process webhooks from GitHub to keep AI agents informed
- **Tool Discovery**: Dynamically discover available tools and their capabilities

### Context Management
- **Conversation History**: Maintain conversation contexts for AI agents
- **Multi-tiered Storage**: Store contexts efficiently across Redis, PostgreSQL, and S3
- **Context Window Management**: Handle token counting, truncation, and optimization
- **Vector Search**: Find semantically similar content using vector embeddings
- **Session Management**: Track conversations across multiple interactions

### Platform Capabilities
- **Extensible Design**: Modular architecture making it easy to add new tool integrations
- **Resilient Processing**: Built-in retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and error handling
- **Performance Optimized**: Connection pooling, caching, and concurrency management
- **Comprehensive Authentication**: Secure API access and webhook verification
- **AWS Integration**: Seamless integration with AWS services using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)

## Queue & Worker Architecture

### Purpose
The queue (AWS SQS or LocalStack SQS) decouples event ingestion (webhooks, API calls) from event processing. This allows the system to:
- Scale event processing independently
- Improve reliability and resilience
- Ensure events are processed asynchronously and idempotently

### How It Works
- The main server enqueues events to SQS when a webhook or API call is received.
- The dedicated `worker` service polls SQS for new messages, processes each event, and updates Redis for idempotency.
- LocalStack is used in development and CI to emulate AWS SQS, enabling full integration testing without real AWS resources.

### Configuration & Environment Variables
- `SQS_QUEUE_URL`: URL of the SQS queue (e.g., `http://localstack:4566/000000000000/test-queue` for LocalStack)
- `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`: Redis connection details
- Both the server and worker must be configured with the same queue and Redis settings for correct operation.

### Message Flow
1. **Webhook/API Event** ‚Üí Main server receives event
2. **Enqueue** ‚Üí Server serializes event and sends to SQS
3. **Poll** ‚Üí Worker polls SQS for new messages
4. **Process** ‚Üí Worker processes event, performs business logic, and sets idempotency key in Redis
5. **Ack/Delete** ‚Üí Worker deletes the message from SQS after successful processing

### Inspecting & Debugging the Queue
- **LocalStack UI**: LocalStack provides a web UI (if enabled) to inspect SQS queues and messages
- **AWS CLI (LocalStack endpoint)**: Use the AWS CLI with `--endpoint-url` to list, send, or receive messages for debugging:
  ```bash
  aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 sqs list-queues
  aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 sqs receive-message --queue-url http://localhost:4566/000000000000/test-queue
  ```
- **Logs**: Both server and worker log SQS operations for traceability
- **Functional Tests**: The test suite exercises the full flow, verifying that events are enqueued, processed, and idempotency is enforced

## üìã Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)
- GitHub account and personal access token (for GitHub integration)

### Running with Docker Compose

The easiest way to get started is with Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/S-Corkum/mcp-server.git
cd mcp-server

# Create configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GitHub token and other settings

# Start the services (main stack)
docker-compose up -d

# For full end-to-end testing (including SQS, worker, and Redis idempotency), use the test compose file:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

#### Worker & Queue Integration
- The system now includes a dedicated `worker` service (see `Dockerfile.worker`), which polls SQS (via LocalStack) and processes queued events.
- LocalStack is used to emulate AWS SQS for local and CI testing.
- Both the main server and the worker connect to the same Redis and SQS instances for realistic integration testing.

#### Functional & Integration Tests
- Functional tests now exercise the full webhook ‚Üí SQS ‚Üí worker ‚Üí Redis flow.
- To run all functional tests with the complete stack:

```bash
make test-functional-verbose
```
- This ensures both the server and worker are running, SQS is emulated, and Redis idempotency is verified.

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Explore the Swagger UI
open http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html
```
