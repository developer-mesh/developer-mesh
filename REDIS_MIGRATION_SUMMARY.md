# Redis Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed the migration from AWS SQS to Redis Streams for the DevOps MCP webhook processing system.

## What Was Done

### 1. Complete SQS Removal
- ✅ Removed all SQS adapter files and implementations
- ✅ Deleted factory pattern as it's no longer needed
- ✅ Removed AWS SDK dependencies from imports
- ✅ Cleaned up all SQS-specific code

### 2. Redis-Only Implementation
- ✅ Created direct Redis queue client (`pkg/queue/queue.go`)
- ✅ Implemented Redis Streams for message queuing
- ✅ Added consumer group support for distributed processing
- ✅ Integrated with existing Redis infrastructure

### 3. Updated Integration Points
- ✅ Webhook handlers now use Redis directly
- ✅ Worker service consumes from Redis Streams
- ✅ Health checks updated to monitor Redis queue
- ✅ All tests updated to use Redis mocks

### 4. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Removed SQS environment variables from config files
- ✅ Added Redis queue configuration (stream name, consumer group)
- ✅ Updated all YAML configs (base, development, production)
- ✅ Cleaned up docker-compose files

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- ✅ Removed AWS SQS environment variables from CI workflow
- ✅ Added Redis configuration to test environments
- ✅ Updated production deployment to remove SQS_QUEUE_URL
- ✅ Added Redis stream configuration to deployment scripts
- ✅ Created workflow documentation

## Key Changes

### Environment Variables
**Removed:**
- `SQS_QUEUE_URL`
- AWS credentials (kept for S3/Bedrock)

**Added:**
- `REDIS_ADDR` / `REDIS_ENDPOINT`
- `REDIS_TLS_ENABLED`
- `REDIS_STREAM_NAME` (default: webhooks)
- `REDIS_CONSUMER_GROUP` (default: webhook-workers)

### Code Structure
- Direct Redis integration without adapters
- Simplified queue interface
- Clean separation of concerns
- Better error handling and health checks

### Benefits
1. **Simplified Architecture**: No more adapter patterns or factory methods
2. **Better Performance**: Redis Streams are optimized for this use case
3. **Cost Reduction**: No AWS SQS charges
4. **Unified Infrastructure**: Everything runs on Redis
5. **Better Monitoring**: Native Redis monitoring tools

## Testing
- ✅ All worker tests passing
- ✅ Redis mock implementations working
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for event formats

## Production Deployment
The application is now fully migrated to Redis. No SQS dependencies remain.

### Next Steps for Production:
1. Deploy with new Redis configuration
2. Monitor Redis stream performance
3. Adjust consumer group settings as needed
4. Set up Redis Sentinel for HA (if not already done)

## Important Notes
- The migration is complete and clean - no SQS code remains
- All tests have been updated and are passing
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing event formats
- Redis TLS is supported and recommended for production
