## Recent Progress Notes

### Architecture Validation and Application Logic Relocation (2025-05-21)

#### Misplaced Application Logic Identified and Relocated:
- **Domain Models**: Moved `Event`, `Context`, `ContextItem`, and related models from `pkg/mcp/event.go` to `apps/mcp-server/internal/core/models/models.go`
- **Adapter Interfaces**: Moved `AdapterManager` and `WebhookHandler` interfaces from `pkg/mcp/interfaces/adapter.go` to `apps/mcp-server/internal/adapters/interfaces/adapter.go`
- **Tool Infrastructure**: Moved core tool infrastructure and GitHub tool provider from `pkg/mcp/tool` to `apps/mcp-server/internal/core/tool` and `apps/mcp-server/internal/api/tools/github`

#### Implementation Approach:
- Created proper target directories in the apps structure
- Added clear deprecation notices to original files
- Ensured backward compatibility while focusing on clean future-state implementation
- Updated import paths in dependent code to maintain functionality

#### Key Architectural Improvements:
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Domain models, adapter interfaces, and tool infrastructure now reside in the appropriate application packages
- **Improved Package Structure**: Clearly separated shared libraries in pkg/ from application-specific code in apps/
- **Forward-Only Migration**: Followed agreed-upon approach, focusing exclusively on clean future-state implementation

#### Next Steps:
- Finish examining remaining interfaces in `pkg/mcp/interfaces`
- Relocate context manager implementation to the apps structure
- Identify any remaining application-specific logic in other pkg/ directories

## Current Phase: Phase 4.2 - Application Logic Relocation

**Progress (2025-05-21)**:
1. ✓ Identified application-specific logic in pkg/ directories
2. ✓ Created inventory of components to be relocated
3. ✓ Developed migration strategy for each component
4. ✓ Validated target locations in apps/mcp-server structure

**Application Logic Inventory**:

| Package | Target Location | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------------|--------|-------|
| pkg/mcp/tool | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/tool | In Progress | Tool definitions and validation already migrated |
| pkg/mcp/tool/github | apps/mcp-server/internal/api/tools/github | In Progress | Tool providers partially migrated |
| pkg/mcp/event.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/models | Needed | Event models and filter functionality |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/adapter.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/interfaces | Needed | Adapter interfaces for MCP components |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/configs.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/config | Needed | Configuration structures and defaults |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/context_manager.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core/context | Needed | Context manager interfaces |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/engine.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/core | Needed | Engine and processing interfaces |
| pkg/mcp/interfaces/webhook_config.go | apps/mcp-server/internal/config | Needed | Webhook configuration structures |

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete the Tool package migration:
   - Verify all functionality is migrated from pkg/mcp/tool to apps/mcp-server/internal/core/tool
   - Complete GitHub tool provider migration
   - Update import paths in dependent code
   - Run tests to verify functionality
2. Migrate Event System:
   - Create appropriate models directory structure
   - Implement clean event models without compatibility layers
   - Update dependent code to use the new location
3. Migrate Interface Definitions:
   - Analyze each interface for optimal placement
   - Implement clean interface design without duplication
   - Update implementation code to use new interfaces

**Phase 3.2 Complete - All High Priority Packages Verified**
- ✓ pkg/aws: AWS configuration and clients
- ✓ pkg/chunking: Content chunking functionality
- ✓ pkg/embedding: Vector embedding services
- ✓ pkg/metrics: Metrics collection and reporting
- ✓ pkg/models: Shared data models

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Continue forward-only migration approach:
   - Focus exclusively on future-state implementation as we did with events
   - Remove compatibility layers and backward compatibility code systematically
   - Use new interfaces exclusively in all code moving forward

2. Apply lessons learned from event system simplification:
   - Identify and remove compatibility files first (look for compat.go, legacy.go, etc.)
   - Fix type declarations and interface definitions
   - Update implementation files with clean, modern Go patterns
   - Ensure all mocks are updated to match the new interfaces

3. For each package:
   - Run initial build to identify errors
   - Remove all legacy/compatibility code
   - Fix specific implementation issues (imports, type mismatches, etc.)
   - Run targeted builds for verification
   - Update tests to match the new implementations

4. Integration verification approach:
   - Verify cross-package dependencies after each package update
   - Ensure updated packages integrate correctly with previously verified packages
   - Run integration tests between related packages
   - Document any patterns that emerge for future phases

**Tools and Techniques**:
- Continue using the established systematic approach for code cleanup
- Apply direct implementation instead of compatibility bridges
- Focus on removing rather than adapting legacy components
- Run incremental builds to verify each step
- Document removal patterns for future package migrations
